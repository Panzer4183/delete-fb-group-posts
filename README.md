# Delete Facebook Group Posts in 2017
An iMacros script to auto delete posts on Facebook groups.

The one that worked is through the **mbasic** mode. I tried making a script for the **desktop** and **mobile** version of Facebook but the delete buttons generate unpredictable POS values. So let's go and clean that spam-infested Facebook group of yours.

###### Step 1
Download the  [_iMacros for Chrome_](http://github.com) extension.

###### Step 2
The extensions can be seen at the top right corner of the browser. Click on the _iMacros for Chrome_ icon to run.

###### Step 3
Go to the **Record** tab just below the yellowish tree pane.

###### Step 4
Click on the **Record Macro** button then click on the **Stop** button. The iMacros Editor will pop out.

###### Step 5
Replace the code inside the editor with this one:

```
SET !TIMEOUT_STEP 0
SET !ERRORIGNORE YES

TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*Comment*
WAIT SECONDS=1

TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Delete
WAIT SECONDS=1

TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT FORM=ACTION:/a/delete.php?* ATTR=*
WAIT SECONDS=1
```

###### Step 6
Hit **Save As & Close** button. Rename the script to something like **delete-fb-group-posts.iim** Make sure you got that extension correctly.

###### Step 7
Go to the **Play** tab. Set the Max value to 99.

###### Step 8
Go to your facebook group's url and make sure your language is set to English.
Example: mbasic.facebook.com/_group-url_


###### Step 9
Hit the **Play Loop** button. See the magic happens.

## Code Explained

<br>

I learned this iMacros scripting just today and I think it might be worth the share.

`SET !TIMEOUT_STEP 0` The elements of the page won't load immediately at times. I'm impatient so I still set the waiting time to zero.

`SET !ERRORIGNORE YES` Ignore any errors so the loop continues. Part of my debugging process.

`TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*Comment*` Select the first `<a>` element that contains the string 'Comment'.

`WAIT SECONDS=1` Change your waiting time if you have a slow connection or computer.

`TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Delete` Select the `<a>` element that contains the string 'Delete'.

`TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT FORM=ACTION:/a/delete.php?* ATTR=*` Select the submit button. This one is tricky. I replaced the long url thing after the `.php?` with a wildcard `*` to make the script work on every iteration of the loop.

Thanks.
